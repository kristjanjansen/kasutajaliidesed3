# Emotion

https://blog.prototypr.io/design-for-emotion-to-increase-user-engagement-3a2560b4b93c

“UX design considers how a user interacts with and responds to an interface, service or product.” That response is an emotion. 

The “experience” actually moves from the

- limbic system (“visceral brain”)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*7KrIHEWcO7KrdqP8OS1zqA.jpeg)
(sikkel)

Visceral design: “I want it. It looks amazing, so will I.” This is an immediate, deep-level gut reaction to your product. As they say “you never get a second chance at making a first impression.” If at this stage the product’s design induces a positive, instinctual reaction you’re on your way. Visceral design also affects the perception of your product’s credibility, trustworthiness, quality, appeal, and even perceived ease of use.

- neocortex (analytical)

Behavioral design: “I can master it. It makes me feel smart.” It has to feel good, look good and perform well. It’s about pleasure with a product’s effectiveness of use. Behavioral design is a concept that focuses on how a structure or system, as viewed by the users, meets their needs and requirements. Good behavioral design is like a lock and key. Customers and their behavior are the lock, the product is the key. Perfect harmony is achieved when the two work smoothly.

- mid-brain (emotion).

Reflective design: “It completes me. I can tell stories about it (and me).” It’s about self-image, personal satisfaction, memories, reflecting back on the experience. Beauty is a desirable feature of the products we buy. Buying and using a product creates a sense of status in society, it’s about socioeconomic status. Your customers ask: “Is it beautiful? Was it a pleasure to use? Did it make my life easier? How do I look using it, driving it, wearing it?” Do your customers “bond” with your product?

> People appreciate visual effects, such as animation, that show that a requested action is being carried out. This is why, when a window is closed, it appears to shrink into a folder or icon. Visual Effects can also add entertainment and excitement to programs that might otherwise seem dull. Why shouldn’t using a computer be fun?

https://medium.com/@rkurata/emotional-design-when-is-it-useful-to-appeal-to-our-negative-emotions-cd5d93e844ec

The first level, **visceral**, is the simplest and lowest of all levels. It is our immediate response to something, and in design terms, it is usually visual design.

The second level, **behavioral**, depends on how effective the product is at completing the task, and how usable the product is. It’s about the user feeling in control and knowing exactly what’s happening. In some sense, this level is like user interaction design. 

The third level, **reflection**, is the most complex and difficult level to achieve. This is where human reflection, memory, and feeling occur, and this is where emotional design comes into play. This is the culmination of all the design details-the colors, the ease of use, the overall experience of using the product. How did it make the user feel, and what is their lasting impression of the product? This is the overall user experience.

http://vintage.agency/blog/motion-for-emotion-why-and-for-what-we-care-about-microinteractions/

They improve a website navigation
They make it easier for users to interact with your website
They provide instant and relevant feedback about a completed action to a user
They give tips to your users
They communicate information about certain elements, like whether or not it’s interactive
They make the user experience much more rewarding
They encourage sharing, liking, and commenting on your content
They direct users’ attention
And, finally, they just make your site more emotional

Well-designed microinteractions are a clear sign of a care of a user. That’s why they value so much. 

When microinteractions are done right, they can give positive feelings about your brand and influence users’ actions, often without people even realizing why.

12 principles of animation

https://vimeo.com/93206523

Aga...

https://uxdesign.cc/caveats-of-motion-in-design-9ce624c5fdf5

The reason motion is both so powerful and dangerous is because it absorbs focus.
We can’t help ourselves to look at things that move. So naturally, when we look at prototypes, we spend a lot of mental energy focusing on how things move, rather than what’s actually on the screen.

https://mahno.com.ua/en/about

![](http://vintage.agency/blog/content/images/2017/05/02_Multimed_flowers.gif)

The animation you spend most time looking at, is your own animation
You love your animation don’t you? I feel you. I replay my animations all the time. It’s part of the process. Once you’re happy with it, you’ll probably play it a few more times. That’s okay. Everyone does.

But then I remembered the old principle of motion: the more often you show the same animation, the less delightful it becomes. Restraint is a critical characteristic only a few motion designers practice. Making sure motion is invisible most of the time, and very visible at specific points in time is key.

# Microinteractions

---

https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/microinteractions-and-their-macro-effect-on-user-experience-part-1/

> iPhone’s mute switch provides multi-modal feedback — the haptic feedback from the switch, the vibration of the device, and the UI overlay on the display.

**Offering informative feedback.** The user wants to be in control and trust that the app behaves as expected. It could be even said that users don’t like surprises. Microinteractions work because they acknowledge user actions and lets users know instantly that it was accepted.

**Providing system status to the user.** Again, the less the users have to guess the better. Microinteractions provide users with needed understanding of the ongoing processes and can guide and teach the users how to interact with the interface.

**Adding a visual delight.** UX delight is part of establishing an emotional connection with your users and reminding them that there are real humans behind the design, and microinteractions are one of the best techniques for giving delightful feedback.

**Speaking like a human.** Good microinteractions help to establish a connection between app and the real world, because they use the same language your user does.

https://current.innovatemap.com/on-the-current-state-of-design-systems-in-ux-4cd0aa1fad71

These things don’t manage themselves. UI standards evolve, aesthetic norms change. Even a fully optimized and automated system will be hard to keep up. Often it can take a full year to have even an MVP built for a design system. By the time you build additional components or templates, the landscape has changed.

In times of growth and experimentation, temper the desire to systemize design. Instead, accept inevitable change, and build the design system when you need scale.

Design is a unique field which blends art and science but with its own mix of abductive reasoning and speculation that can lead to unpredictably amazing solutions. Implementing design systems in organizations must be done with care so as to optimize the right parts, while still offering the creative, untethered freedom design needs to explore. We should all be so lucky to nurture a product to the point where design systems are critical. But until that happens I advocate caution and keep focus on innovation.

**Patterns** describe how something SHOULD work under preferred conditions and suggestions of how to cope with tradeoffs.
Patterns may be UI or a variety of other things, like a behavior, flow, application motif or something else.

**Components** are how something DOES work, inclusive of tradeoffs and constraints realized through a build process.
Components are an interface chunk to be added to an overall layout.

The style guide is an **artifact**, the design system is a **process**.

**Design system** is a process and therefore is simultaneously always ready and never done.

**-> Design ops**

The more inconsistent the user experience, the slower product development 

Of course, users suffer the most. A Google Research study from 2012 showed that users prefer simple interfaces, which seem familiar. They seek out experiences consistent with other experiences on the platform. We crave familiarity. Every new pattern responsible for the same action, or visual inconsistency, creates an unnecessary pause and an eventual burden.
Consistency introduces feelings of safety and familiarity. Inconsistency creates chaos and confusion.

# Problems

https://blog.prototypr.io/atomic-design-in-practice-does-it-work-9655bacb49d7

Isolation

As soon as patterns are combined into layouts the temptation quickly becomes to use that as the reference point and avoid the individual (perhaps non-representative) pattern views.

Frankenstein’s monster

Having a toolkit of pre-made patterns makes it very tempting to cobble together a solution instead of devising something more appropriate from scratch.

Adaptability

Components have no knowledge of their own width, problematic if they’re going to be dropped into different containers.
