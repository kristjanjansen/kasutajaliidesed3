## Transforms

The Transform is used to store a GameObjectâ€™s position, rotation, scale and parenting state and is thus very important. A GameObject will always have a Transform component attached - it is not possible to remove a Transform or to create a GameObject without one.

### Editing Transforms

Transforms are manipulated in 3D space in the X, Y, and Z axes or in 2D space in just X and Y. In Unity, these axes are represented by the colors red, green, and blue respectively.

A Transform can be edited in the Scene View or by changing its properties in the Inspector. In the scene, you can modify Transforms using the Move, Rotate and Scale tools. These tools are located in the upper left-hand corner of the Unity Editor.
